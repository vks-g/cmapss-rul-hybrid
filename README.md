# cmapss-rul-hybrid

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for turbofan engines on the NASA C-MAPSS dataset. We compare regression on engineered degradation features (ML, Phase 1) against sequence models that learn directly from raw sensor windows (DL, Phase 2). A hybrid model then fuses the two.

## Problem

Each engine in C-MAPSS is a multivariate time series of 3 operating settings and 21 sensors, recorded once per cycle, that runs until failure. The task is to predict how many cycles a test engine has left, given its history up to some point before failure.

Fixed rolling-window features may miss long degradation trajectories and interactions whose timing differs across engines. This project tests whether sequence models close that gap. The full brief is in [`docs/project_brief.md`](docs/project_brief.md).

## Approach

| Phase | Method | Models |
|---|---|---|
| 1: ML | Engineered features: cycle, rolling mean/slope, operating regime, sensor health | Random Forest, XGBoost, Elastic Net |
| 2: DL | Fixed-length sensor windows | LSTM, Temporal CNN, Transformer encoder |
| 2: Hybrid | Sequence encoder + engineered-feature branch, fused into one regression head | Fusion model |

**Fair comparison.** All models share the same engine-level splits (by `unit` id, never by row) and the same metrics: RMSE and MAE on RUL, NASA score, and error by degradation stage (early / mid / late).

Operating-regime normalization uses `rul.features.regimes.RegimeNormalizer`. Fit it on each training fold, then reuse that fitted object for validation and test data:

```python
from rul.features.regimes import RegimeNormalizer

normalizer = RegimeNormalizer(n_regimes=6, random_state=42)  # FD002 / FD004
train_scaled = normalizer.fit(train_fold).transform(train_fold)
valid_scaled = normalizer.transform(validation_fold)
test_scaled = normalizer.transform(test)
```

Use `n_regimes=1` for FD001 / FD003. The transform preserves metadata columns, replaces the 21 sensor columns with per-regime z-scores, and adds a `regime` column. Never fit it on validation or test rows.

## Dataset

NASA C-MAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation (Saxena et al., 2008). FD001 is the primary subset; FD002–FD004 are extensions.

The raw data is not committed. Download instructions are under Setup.
